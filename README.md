# Personal Website

After learning Three.js, I wanted to revamp my webiste and somehow add Three.js to my site. I had the idea of showcasing my projects on billboards and having my portfolio be a building. 
The best way to do that was to learn and build the model on Blender, but I felt that learning Blender and building the model would take too long.
So instead, I learned Spline 3D, a 3D design software that can add interactive 3D elements to your site. It was much faster to learn and build. Plus, I like the low-poly style. I'm very happy with how it turned out.
